    <h2>We focus on affordability</h2>
    <h3>
      Its a trend for other schools to garnish your money after you finish their
      program and start working as a developer.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Goal is your goal: to get you started in a career. We help you achieve
      success, we dont profit from it.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Thats why we keep our total costs low, so that more students can complete
      our course and enjoy their dream.
    </h3>
